In an effort to understand the factors that contribute to heterogeneity in
outcomes often associated with mTBI in youth, this study examined the role of
premorbid differences in cognitive reserve on post-concussive symptoms (PCS),
molecular markers, and treatment response. Male and female rats matured in one of
three environmental conditions (Stress, Enrichment, Control), received a mTBI in 
adolescence, and were randomized to melatonin or placebo treatment. All animals
underwent a behavioural test battery designed to examine PCS. Using prefrontal
cortex and hippocampus tissue, expression of 9 genes was assessed in an effort to
determine how the brain's epigenome was influenced by cognitive reserve, mTBI,
and melatonin. Enrichment increased cognitive reserve (CR) and prevented
lingering symptoms. Conversely, stress was associated with progressive worsening 
and manifestation of PCS in the longer-term. Melatonin was able to restore
baseline function for control and enriched animals, but was ineffective for the
stress condition. Epigenetic change in the prefrontal cortex was largely driven
by the injury, while gene expression changes in the hippocampus were dependent
upon cognitive reserve. The occurrence and severity of PCS is dependent upon a
complex and multifaceted array of factors that modify behavioural and epigenetic 
responses to mTBI and its treatment.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) has a complex etiology and is characterized by a 
change in mood and psychophysiological state. MDD has been shown to mediate
accelerated biological aging in patients, although the underlying mechanism is
not well understood. In the present study, we used a chronic mild stress (CMS)
paradigm to induce anhedonia, one of the main symptoms of MDD. CMS induced
depression-like symptoms in rats, including reduced sucrose preference and
increased immobility time in the forced swim test. Moreover, stressed rats
travelled a shorter total distance, had fewer grid line crossings, and spent less
time in the outer zone in the open field test than controls. CMS altered the
levels of 5-hydroxytryptophan, dopamine, and corticosterone in the serum and
hippocampus (P<0.05); these rats also exhibited impaired liver function,
decreased telomerase activity, and telomere shortening, which was associated with
increased oxidative damage along with decreased superoxide dismutase and
glutathione reductase activities. Mitochondria in CMS-treated rats showed
ultrastructural damage as well as reduced DNA content and integrity. These
findings provide physiological and cellular evidence that the MDD can mediate
accelerated aging in rats.

Despite the most common form of brain injury, there has been little progress in
the prognosis and treatment of concussion/mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI).
Current 'return-to-play' guidelines are conservative, deterring the initiation of
physical and social activity until patients are asymptomatic; but the effects of 
post-injury exercise have not been adequately investigated. Therefore, this study
examined the effects of voluntary exercise on concussion recovery. Using a
translational rodent model of concussion, we examined the influence of exercise
on injury-associated behaviours that comprise post-concussive syndrome (PCS) and 
gene expression changes (bdnf, dnmt1, Igf-1, pgc1-a, Tert) in prefrontal cortex
and hippocampus. In addition, as we have previously demonstrated telomere length 
(TL) to be a reliable predictor of mTBI prognosis, TL was also examined. The
results suggest that exercise initiated within 1-3 days post-concussion
significantly improved motor and cognitive functioning, but had limited efficacy 
treating emotional impairments. What is more, when deprived of social interaction
and exercise, a combination similar to clinical recommendations for rest until
symptom resolution, animals did not recover and exhibited impairments similar to 
typical mTBI animals. Exercise aided in restoration of mTBI-induced modifications
to gene expression in both brain regions. An inverse relationship between the
exercise return interval and TL was identified, indicating greater recovery with 
acute exercise reinstatement. Although additional strategies may need to be
employed for emotional functioning, these findings support re-evaluation of
'return-to-play' guidelines, suggesting that exercise is valuable for the
treatment of concussion.

The role of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) has been extensively
investigated in the contexts of aging and cancer. Interestingly, Tert(-/-) mice
exhibit additional but unexpected aggressive and depressive behaviors, implying
the potential involvement of TERT function in mood control. Our conditional
rescue experiments revealed that the depressive and aggressive behaviors of
Tert(-/-) mice originate from Tert deficiency in two distinct brain structures.
Reactivation of Tert in the hippocampus was sufficient to normalize the
depressive but not the aggressive behaviors of Tert(-/-) mice. Conversely,
re-expression of Tert in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) reversed the
aggressive but not the depressive behavior of Tert(-/-) mice. Mechanistically,
decreased serotonergic signaling and increased nitric oxide (NO) transmission in 
the hippocampus transduced Tert deficiency into depression as evidenced by our
observation that the infusion of a pharmacological agonist for serotonin receptor
1a (5-HTR1A) and a selective antagonist for neuronal NO synthase into the
hippocampus successfully normalized the depressive behavior of Tert(-/-) mice. In
addition, increased serotonergic transmission by the 5-HTR1A agonist in the mPFC 
was sufficient to rescue the aggressive behavior of Tert(-/-) mice. Thus, our
studies revealed a novel function of TERT in the pathology of depression and
aggression in a brain structure-specific manner, providing direct evidence for
the contribution of TERT to emotional control.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to explore the telomere length of
peripheral blood leukocytes from a rat model of post-traumatic stress disorder
(PTSD), as well as the expression level of telomere-binding protein in the
hippocampal CA1 region.
METHODS: The PTSD model was established with 42 adult male Wistar rats. The
relative telomere length of the leukocytes was measured by real-time fluorescence
quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and the expression levels of telomere
repeating factor 1 (TRF1) and telomere repeating factor 2 (TRF2) in the
hippocampal CA1 region of the PTSD rat model were determined by
immunofluorescence technology. The covariance analysis of repeated measurements
by the mixed model approach was used for the telomere length analysis. The
comparison of averaged data among groups was performed using least significant
difference and analysis of variance. The Student's t test or the Mann-Whitney U
test was used for intragroup comparison. The association study among groups was
conducted using the Spearman test.
RESULTS: The shortening speed of telomere length significantly accelerated in
rats after Single Prolonged Stress (SPS) stimulation (P<0.05). The expression
levels of TRF1 and TRF2 increased with the progress of PTSD, and the expression
peak was shown in day 14, which was significantly different from the control
group (P<0.05).
CONCLUSION: The shortening speed of the telomere length of peripheral blood
leukocytes accelerated in PTSD rats, and the expression levels of TRF1 and TRF2
increased in hippocampus, both of which were closely associated with the
pathological progress of the PTSD-like model and unfavorable prognosis.

OBJECTIVE: To summarise and discuss the association between telomerase activity
and psychological stress, mental disorders and lifestyle factors.
METHOD: A systematic review was carried out to identify prospective or
retrospective studies and interventions published up to June 2015 that reported
associations between telomerase activity and psychological stress, mental
disorders and lifestyle factors. Electronic data bases of PubMed, ProQuest,
CINAHL and Google Scholar were searched.
RESULTS: Twenty six studies on humans measured telomerase activity in peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) or leukocytes and examined its association with
psychological stress, mental disorders and lifestyle factors. Of those studies,
three reported significantly decreased telomerase activity in individuals under
chronic psychological stress. Interestingly, one of the three studies found that 
acute laboratory psychological stress significantly increased telomerase
activity. Nine studies reported mixed results on association between mental
disorders and telomerase activity. Of the nine studies, five reported that major 
depressive disorder (MDD) was associated with significantly increased telomerase 
activity. In thirteen out of fourteen studies on lifestyle factors, it was
reported that physical exercise, diet micronutrient supplementation, mindfulness 
meditation, Qigong practice or yoga mediation resulted in increase in telomerase 
activity. In addition, two studies on animal models showed that depression-like
behaviour was associated with decreased hippocampus telomerase activity. Five
animal studies showed that physical exercise increased telomerase activity by
cell-type-specific and genotype-specific manners.
CONCLUSION: Although multi-facet results were reported on the association between
telomerase activity and psychological stress, mental disorders and lifestyle
factors, there were some consistent findings in humans such as (1) decreased
telomerase activity in individuals under chronic stress, (2) increased telomerase
activity in individuals with MDD, and (3) increased telomerase activity in
individuals under lifestyle interventions. Animal studies showed that physical
exercise increased telomerase activity in specific cell-types. However, the exact
mechanisms for the changes in telomerase activity have not been elucidated. We
propose conglomerate models connecting chronic psychological stress, depression, 
mediation and physical exercise to telomerase activation. Several areas for
future research are suggested.

Leukocyte telomere length has been shown to correlate to hippocampus volume, but 
effect estimates differ in magnitude and are not uniformly positive. This study
aimed primarily to investigate the relationship between leukocyte telomere length
and hippocampus gray matter volume by meta-analysis and secondarily
to investigate possible effect moderators. Five studies were included with a
total of 2107 participants, of which 1960 were contributed by one single
influential study. A random-effects meta-analysis estimated the effect to r =
0.12 [95% CI -0.13, 0.37] in the presence of heterogeneity and a subjectively
estimated moderate to high risk of bias. There was no evidence that
apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype was an effect moderator, nor that the ratio of
leukocyte telomerase activity to telomere length was a better predictor than
leukocyte telomere length for hippocampus volume. This meta-analysis, while not
proving a positive relationship, also is not able to disprove the earlier finding
of a positive correlation in the one large study included in analyses. We propose
that a relationship between leukocyte telomere length and hippocamus volume may
be mediated by transmigrating monocytes which differentiate into microglia in the
brain parenchyma.

Brain-derived Neurotrophic Factor Signaling Pathway: Modulation by Acupuncture in
Telomerase Knockout Mice.

Lin D, Wu Q, Lin X, Borlongan CV, He ZX, Tan J, Cao C, Zhou SF.

CONTEXT: Telomerase is a critical enzyme that is involved in aging and cancer and
that is thought to be a part of multiple neurological diseases.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the telomerase response in the brain to acupuncture,
the study examined the levels of expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor 
(BDNF) and its downstream signaling molecules, including tyrosine kinase receptor
Β (TrkB), p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR), protein kinase B (Akt),
extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK1/2), and nuclear factor κΒ
(NF-κΒ).
DESIGN: Both telomerase-deficient (Terc⁻/⁻) mice (Terc⁻/⁻ group) and normal,
wild-type (WT) mice (WT group) were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 subgroups, 1
receiving acupuncture (acupuncture subgroup), 1 receiving sham acupuncture
therapy (sham subgroup), and 1 receiving no treatment (control subgroup).
SETTING: The study occurred at the University of South Florida Health Byrd
Alzheimer's Institute (Tampa, FL, USA).
INTERVENTION: The 2 acupuncture subgroups received acupuncture at the stomach 36 
(ST-36) position for 30 min/d for 4 d. For the 2 sham groups, the sham point was 
set at a location approximately 3 mm to the lateral side of the tail on the
gluteus muscle following the same schedule.
OUTCOME MEASURES: After 4 d, the mice were sacrificed, and the brain tissues were
collected. The protein levels in the hippocampus and dentate gyrus (DG) of each
mouse were determined by western blotting and immunostaining assays.
RESULTS: The Terc⁻/⁻ group showed downregulated hippocampal BDNF expression
compared with the WT mice. Acupuncture at ST-36 for 4 d upregulated BDNF, TrkB,
p75NTR, Akt, and ERK1/2 in the DG and hippocampus of the telomerase-deficient
mice, but that result was not seen in the WT mice with normally functioning
telomerase.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of acupuncture in pathologies associated with telomerase
deficiencies, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), may 
provide some benefit in terms of eliciting better clinical responses. The
research team believes that result occurs through the activation of BDNF and its 
downstream signaling pathways in populations of patients who exhibit low
telomerase activity.

Several studies have reported that adults with major depressive disorder have
shorter telomere length and reduced hippocampal volumes. Moreover, studies of
adult populations without major depressive disorder suggest a relationship
between peripheral telomere length and hippocampal volume. However, the
relationship of these findings in adolescents with major depressive disorder has 
yet to be explored. We examined whether adolescent major depressive disorder is
associated with altered peripheral telomere length and hippocampal volume, and
whether these measures relate to one another. In 54 unmedicated adolescents
(13-18 years) with major depressive disorder and 63 well-matched healthy
controls, telomere length was assessed from saliva using quantitative polymerase 
chain reaction methods, and bilateral hippocampal volumes were measured with
magnetic resonance imaging. After adjusting for age and sex (and total brain
volume in the hippocampal analysis), adolescents with major depressive disorder
exhibited significantly shorter telomere length and significantly smaller right, 
but not left hippocampal volume. When corrected for age, sex, diagnostic group
and total brain volume, telomere length was not significantly associated with
left or right hippocampal volume, suggesting that these cellular and neural
processes may be mechanistically distinct during adolescence. Our findings
suggest that shortening of telomere length and reduction of hippocampal volume
are already present in early-onset major depressive disorder and thus unlikely to
be only a result of accumulated years of exposure to major depressive disorder.

Endothelin-1 (ET-1), tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), and extracellular
signal-regulated kinases-mitogen activated protein kinase (ERK-MAPK) are
mediators of impaired cerebral hemodynamics after fluid percussion brain injury
(FPI) in piglets. Microparticles (MPs) are released into the circulation from a
variety of cells during stress, are pro-thrombotic and pro-inflammatory, and may 
be lysed with polyethylene glycol telomere B (PEG-TB). We hypothesized that MPs
released after traumatic brain injury impair hypotensive cerebrovasodilation and 
that PEG-TB protects the vascular response via MP lysis, and we investigated the 
relationship between MPs, tPA, ET-1, and ERK-MAPK in that process. FPI was
induced in piglets equipped with a closed cranial window. Animals received PEG-TB
or saline (vehicle) 30-minutes post-injury. Serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
were sampled and pial arteries were measured pre- and post-injury. MPs were
quantified by flow cytometry. CSF samples were analyzed with enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay. MP levels, vasodilatory responses, and CSF signaling assays 
were similar in all animals prior to injury and treatment. After injury, MP
levels were elevated in the serum of vehicle but not in PEG-TB-treated animals.
Pial artery dilation in response to hypotension was impaired after injury but
protected in PEG-TB-treated animals. After injury, CSF levels of tPA, ET-1, and
ERK-MAPK were all elevated, but not in PEG-TB-treated animals. PEG-TB-treated
animals also showed reduction in neuronal injury in CA1 and CA3 hippocampus,
compared with control animals. These results show that serum MP levels are
elevated after FPI and lead to impaired hypotensive cerebrovasodilation via
over-expression of tPA, ET-1, and ERK-MAPK. Treatment with PEG-TB after injury
reduces MP levels and protects hypotensive cerebrovasodilation and limits
hippocampal neuronal cell injury.

JWA (Arl6ip5), a homologous gene of glutamate-transporter-associated protein 3-18
(GTRAP3-18) and addicsin, is highly expressed in hippocampus. We generated
systemic and neuronal JWA knockout (JWA-KO and JWA-nKO) mice to investigate the
influence of JWA deficiency on spatial cognitive performance, process of
neurogenesis, and induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in hippocampal
dentate gyrus (DG). In comparison with wild-type (WT) mice and JWA (loxP/loxP)
(control of JWA-nKO) mice, 8-week-old JWA-KO mice and JWA-nKO mice showed spatial
cognitive potentiation as assessed by Morris water maze test. In hippocampal DG
of JWA-nKO mice, either survival and migration or neurite growth of newborn
neurons were significantly enhanced without the changes in proliferation and
differentiation of stem cells. In addition, the increase of LTP amplitude and the
decline of LTP threshold were observed in DG, but not in CA1 region, of JWA-nKO
mice compared to control mice. The levels of hippocampal FAK, Akt, and mTOR
phosphorylation in JWA-nKO mice were higher than those in control mice. The PI3K 
or FAK inhibitor could abolish the enhanced neurogenesis and LTP induction in
JWA-nKO mice, which was accompanied by disappearance of the spatial cognitive
potentiation. The treatment of JWA-nKO mice with 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine
(AZT), a telomerase inhibitor, suppressed not only the enhanced neurogenesis but 
also the enhanced LTP induction in DG, but it did not affect the LTP induction in
CA1 region. The results suggest that the JWA deficiency through cascading
FAK-PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway increases the newborn neurons and enhances the LTP
induction in hippocampal DG, which leads to the spatial cognitive potentiation.
